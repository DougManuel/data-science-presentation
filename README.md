## Outline
1) Imperitive
2) Open Science toolkit. Focus on:
   - Open source
   - Open methodology
   - Open educational resources
3) Example: Project Big Life predictive algorithm workflow with bllflow.

### Internationally, a growing voice of concern about research reproducitibity

> “Academic institutions can and must do better. We should be taking multiple approaches to make science more reliable.”

*Jeffrey Flier*. Dean of Medicine, Harvard University. Nature 549, 133 (2017)

>“Put simply, this means that researchers should make their computational workflow and data available for others to view. 
> They should include the code used to generate published figures and omit only data that cannot be released for privacy or legal reasons.”

*Jeffrey M. Perkel*. A toolkit for data transparency takes shape. Nature 560, 513-515 (2018)

>"More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments."

*Monya Baker*. 1,500 scientists lift the lid on reproducibility. Nature 533, 452-4 (2016)

### Imperitive continued

Research (using routinely-collected data) is often poor quality.
- Inefficient, lacks transparency, and not is reproducible.
- Errors and omissions can and do change study conclusions. E.g., 
   - bias is introduced into your study if you change your plan after 
you examine your outcome; or, 
   - you fail to report all analyses. 
 
Big data and more complex analytic models are stressing our research workflow.

## Toolkit

### Git

Use Git if either of these issues applies to you.

1. You have files like this: `my_great_study_final_final_final.sas`
2. If you collaborate or share code with others.
   Science is about collaboration and sharing ideas.
