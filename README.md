# Presentation

Data science to improve research. Improve quality, openness, reproducibility and efficiency for studies that use rountinely-collected data.

## Outline

1) Housekeeping - general notes for the presentation.
1) What is data science? A very brief introduction.
1) Imperitives - challenges for research.
1) Examples of questions I ask students to gauge their data science implementation.
1) Example: the workflow we use to create algorithms for [Project Big Life](https://projectbiglife.ca)

## 1) Housekeeping
1) After the presentation: please complete an evaluation. [Link](https://projectbiglife.typeform.com/to/qMhO7F)
1) Want a Project Big Life Hexigon sticker? Just send make say 'hi' or make a comment in [issues](https://github.com/DougManuel/data_science_presentation/issues/1) and we'll send one out to you. There is a link to a form where you can send us your mailing address. (Really, we just want to encourage you to try out git and GitHub.)

## 3) Imperitives

### Internationally, a growing voice of concern about research reproducitibity

> “Academic institutions can and must do better. We should be taking multiple approaches to make science more reliable.”

*Jeffrey Flier*. Dean of Medicine, Harvard University. Nature 549, 133 (2017)

>“Put simply, this means that researchers should make their computational workflow and data available for others to view. 
> They should include the code used to generate published figures and omit only data that cannot be released for privacy or legal reasons.”

*Jeffrey M. Perkel*. A toolkit for data transparency takes shape. Nature 560, 513-515 (2018)

### Imperitive continued

Research (using routinely-collected data) is often poor quality.
- Inefficient, lacks transparency, and not is reproducible.
- Errors and omissions can and do change study conclusions. E.g., 
   - bias is introduced into your study if you change your plan after 
you examine your outcome; or, 
   - you fail to report all analyses. 
 
Big data and more complex analytic models are stressing our research workflow

## Toolkit

### Git

Use Git if either of these issues applies to you.

1. You have files like this: `my_great_study_final_final_final.sas`
2. If you collaborate or share code with others.
   Science is about collaboration and sharing ideas.
